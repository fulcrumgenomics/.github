## Hi there üëã 

[Fulcrum Genomics](https://fulcrumgenomics.com/) Speaks Biology.

We are bioinformaticians, computational biologists, and software engineers with experience in basic research, technology development, diagnostics, therapeutics and beyond.
Talk to us about your problem ‚Äì we‚Äôll understand.

Below are [Toolkits](#toolkits), [Libraries](#libraries), and [Template Repositories](#template-repositories) that we've developed and use on a regular basis.
We hope that you will find them useful too!

### Toolkits üõ†Ô∏è
Here are some _toolkits_ we've developed:

* [fgbio](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/fgbio): Tools for working with genomic and high throughput sequencing data in Scala.
* [fgsv](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/fgsv): Tools to gather evidence for structural variation via breakpoint detection.
* [fqtk](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/fqtk): Fast FASTQ sample demultiplexing in Rust.
* [fqgrep](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/fqgrep): Grep for FASTQ files.
* [stitch](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/stitch): Stitch is a toolkit for analysis of chimeric reads in sequencing data.
* [guide-counter](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/guide-counter): A better, faster way to count guides in CRISPR screens.
* [bwa](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/bwa/tree/interactive_aln): A fork of [bwa](https://github.com/lh3/bwa) to run interactively work with bwa on the command line.


### Libraries üìö

Here are some _libraries_ that we use regularly in our work:

* Python
  * [fgpyo](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/fgpyo): Quality of life improvements for Bioinformatics in Python.
  * [pybedlite](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/pybedlite): Lightweight Python interfaces for reading, writing, and querying Genomic Regions (BED).
* Rust
  * [fgoxide](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/fgoxide): Quality of life improvements for Bioinformatics in Rust.
  * [read-structure](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/read-structure): Read structures in rust.
  * [pooled-writer](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/pooled-writer): A pooled writer and compressor library in Rust.
  * [bgzf](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/bgzf): High level readers and writers for the BGZF format in Rust.
* Scala
  * [fgprimer](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/fgprimer): APIs and wrappers for performing PCR primer design related tasks in Scala.
  * [sopt](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/sopt): An argument parsing library for Scala.
  * [commons](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/commons): A collection of useful libraries for Scala.
* GitHub Actions
  * [setup-latch](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/setup-latch): A GitHub action for building and register Latch Bio workflows.

### Template Repositories üèÅ

Here are some _template_ repositories we use when we start something new:
* [python-snakemake-template](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/python-snakemake-template): A template repository for Snakemake pipepline(s) and a python command-line toolkit.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
üçø Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
üßô Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
