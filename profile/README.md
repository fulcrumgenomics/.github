## Hi there 👋 

[Fulcrum Genomics](https://fulcrumgenomics.com/) Speaks Biology.

We are bioinformaticians, computational biologists, and software engineers with experience in basic research, technology development, diagnostics, therapeutics and beyond. Talk to us about your problem – we’ll understand.

Below are [Toolkits](#toolkits), [Libraries](#libraries), and [Template Repositories](#template-repositories) that we've developed and use on a regular basis.  We hope that you will find them useful too!

### Toolkits 
Here are some _toolkits_ we've developed:

* [fgbio](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/fgbio): Tools for working with genomic and high throughput sequencing data in Scala.
* [fgsv](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/fgsv): Tools to gather evidence for structural variation via breakpoint detection.
* [fqtk](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/fqtk): Fast FASTQ sample demultiplexing in Rust.
* [fqgrep](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/fqgrep): Grep for FASTQ files.
* [stitch](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/stitch): Stitch is a toolkit for analysis of chimeric reads in sequencing data.
* [guide-counter](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/guide-counter): A better, faster way to count guides in CRISPR screens.
* [bwa](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/bwa/tree/interactive_aln): A fork of [bwa](https://github.com/lh3/bwa) to run interactively work with bwa on the command line.


### Libraries

Here are some _libraries_ that we use regularly in our work:

* Python
  * [fgpyo](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/fgpyo): Quality of life improvements for Bioinformatics in Python.
  * [pybedlite](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/pybedlite): Lightweight Python interfaces for reading, writing, and querying Genomic Regions (BED).
* Rust
  * [fgoxide](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/fgoxide): Quality of life improvements for Bioinformatics in Rust.
  * [read-structure](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/read-structure): Read structures in rust.
  * [pooled-writer](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/pooled-writer): A pooled writer and compressor library in Rust.
  * [bgzf](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/bgzf): High level readers and writers for the BGZF format in Rust.
* Scala
  * [fgprimer](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/fgprimer): APIs and wrappers for performing PCR primer design related tasks in Scala.
  * [sopt](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/sopt): An argument parsing library for Scala.
  * [commons](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/commons): A collection of useful libraries for Scala.
* GitHub Actions
  * [setup-latch](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/setup-latch): A GitHub action for building and register Latch Bio workflows.

### Template Repositories

Here are some _template_ repositories:
* [python-snakemake-template](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/python-snakemake-template) A template repository for Snakemake pipepline(s) and a python command-line toolkit.
